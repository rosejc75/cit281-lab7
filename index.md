## Welcome to Rose's Lab 7
In this lab we used GitHub and created our own organization.


### Organization
In this lab we created our own GitHub organization for the CIT minor. We created our first repository and then cloned it in our terminal window using the command "git clone https://github.com/UO-CIT-rosejc75/cit281-lab7.git". we then created a lab JS file and initialized it as a Node.js folder using previous commands we have learned.

### Error Handling
We then updated our lab-07 to play aroun with try..catch..finally, throw. We created our own CustomerError class that takes on error when the class name is CustomError. We experimented with try..catch..finally and console.log debug statements. Finally, we comitted the changes in the terminal.
